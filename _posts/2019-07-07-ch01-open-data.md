## Topic Overview

Data is everywhere around us. Data is collected through so many ways and can answer so many questions, but the biggest question is what questions need to be answered. A commonality that I am seeing is that data provides and insight into topics that otherwise have no way of understanding measurement. There are problems, and people have ideas about possible solutions but only until they look at the math can they truly make predicitons. In the material that is covered so far I am seeing that there is not limit to the magmintude of projects that can be tackled with the appropriate amount of infomration. All over the US we rely on oranizations such as the farmers almanac and the National Weather serice for weather predications, and in many cases those organizations save lives! The overview for starting this class tells me one thing, and that is the big pools of data arent isn't a window into American life, but it is the only way for us truly understand the world we live in. 


## Chapter Summaries

### Social Physics **CH5: data as a public good pp 148-179,179-188**

Lets talk about DJ Patil and some of the history that the US Government has had with open data. Back in 1996 Dj began to hack the Department of Commerce servers while he was attending University of Maryland just to see what kind of data he could find and what he could do with it, fast foward to 2014 and he was asked to 2014 as President Obama asks him to the White House to Be their "Data Scientist". DJ had a very strong background and understanding of the power of data and what that could mean for finding better uses for the data collected from the US Government.
The US Department of Commerce (aka Department of Science and Technology) is much more than its name, it collects and makes sense of all of the countrys economic statistics which are instramental in understanding our cultural and creating a decision based science that are windows into American life. The data that the US Department of COmmerce has collected is years of stastical information from every area, and just one of those areas is weather. That data collected from billions of dollars of devices and research is where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service, National Census and many other oranganizations both private and public get its information from and how they store / share information. Many people have used the data from the government for uses such as starting private businesses in helping farming, creating private weather reporting organizations such as AccuWeather and using them to see patterns within our own government so that we can become more efficient in our programs and how the government operates overall. Transparency of our data has been protected for a long time but our President and who is in charge of the individual departments monitor what is released to the public. As President Trump took office the transparency of governmnet data started to disappear as many of the reports that citizens used to be able to view either had much less information to them or they completely disappeared. That is where the story of our countrys first chief data scientist and all of what data can offer starts to come to an end.

### Digital Humanitarians **CH1 Rise of Digital Humanitarianism**

One minute after the Haiti Earthquake in Jan 2010 a man, Patrick Meier from Boston, MA sprung into action to search for his wife in Port Au Prince. This effort quickly evolved into what we know today as digital humanitarianism. Feeling helpless and craving a constant information, Patrick looked first to CNN and then to Social Media. The result in his efforts was a Haiti Crisis Map. This map used social media outlets such as Twitter, Facebook, Skype, and Google to depict places that individuals were “checking in” geographically. The data and information pulled from social media was so vast and in excess that hundreds of volunteers were trained to manage and map it. This effort evolved into a support structure for Search and Rescue teams (SARs) to tap into. The Map was a direct result in life saving efforts that took place to rescue individuals. This effort grew when an SMS number was set up and provided on radio networks bringing even more data and information in. These SMS messages overwhelmed the volunteer teams yet again and messages had to be filtered to include only those with life safety issues that could be acted on. This Chapter closes with the impacts of all those volunteers waiting through traumatic information and the toll that it can take on your physical and psychological state. Remember what FEMA Task Force 3 advises… Take shifts, get sleep, and get a therapist.

## Key Take-Aways:
The true meaning of open data is a huge question, including the transparency and responsiblity between who has the data and who has access to the data. 

### Discussion Questions

### Social Physics **CH1 From Ideas to Action Discussion Questions**
1. Since our government (including individual departments) collects mass data and raw information, as tax paying citizens, should all of that be given to us without restriction and for us to use as we see fit.
2. Should programs that are offered completely by government driven data (i.e NOAA) be in fear of competition of private companies? Should the safety and security of our people (and paid for by tax dollars) be able to be overthrown by private corporations doing the same thing for profit?
3. What are the responsibilties of the government (and each departmnet) when it comes to how they monitor and distribute the data collected?

### Digital Humanitarians **CH1 Rise of Digital Humanitarianism Discussion Questions**
1. Given that all the information on the GPS phones was utilized to locate those that sending out tweets, and all the research and work was conducted on personal laptops, what happens to all the data once the incident response is over? How is all this data managed today and utilized from the haiti response?
2. Does the timeframe of an organization or individual to stand-up this a system to track disaster information have the same significance as just trying to track data from another source… like the NOAA?
3. What is the most effective way to mine data so that it is quickly actionable for those that need it?

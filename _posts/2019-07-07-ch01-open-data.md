### Reality Mining: Census, Mobile Phones, and Internet Giants
Access to data in many formats is available publicly. Some examples of this data are the Census and the World Bank's International Survey. Google uses World Bank data to integrate simple visualization into its search results. Other sources may include Call Data records or CDRs, which are kept more closely to the chest of the cell phone service providers. This information can be used to identify time and general location of where a call or text was made by the recipient. Models of human movement & social networks can be developed from the CDR data and had become increasingly popular for researchers.In the Chapter it is noted that the gender, birthdate and Zip Code coupled with Census information can result in an individual being uniquely identified 63-87% of the time in data collection. AT&T is developing a group called WHERE (Work and Home Extracted Regions). This group is responsible for maintaining the privacy of AT&Ts clients. The group creates synthetic CDRs and notes that “The main benefit of these synthetic CDRs is that they maintain the privacy of individuals because no data from real individuals are used” (Eagle, N., & Greene, K.2014). 

Google and Facebook utilize their data for an advertising network. 
“Both companies also provide general statistics such as the number of emails or profiles your ad appears in. It’s this information that can be mined to determine overall sentiment toward a product across demographics…Facebook also offers an API that allows programmers to build applications that plug into Facebook users’ profiles.21 From these applications, a programmer can get access to as much information as a Facebook customer allows in his or her privacy settings, including phone numbers, contact lists, status updates, and any other identifying information” (Eagle, N., & Greene, K.2014).

Twitter’s data is largely represented on a public scale. They offer an API for researchers to tap into called “Twitter Fire Hose”. This however presents many issues as tweets are often fragmented with hashtags and alike. Given that all this data availble, it is important to forcus on how it can be best utilized. Many keepers of the CDRs are begining to realize that information can be used effectively in large scale circumstances.

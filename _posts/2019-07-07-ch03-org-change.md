## The Challenges of Big Data 

### Weapons of Math Destruction: Intro

### Big Data for Social Innovation
“The term ‘big data’ is used to describe the growing proliferation of data and our increasing ability to make productive use of it.” (Desouza & Smith, 2014, p. 39). The key focus of this article is that data is nothing without knowing how to use it. The authors ask a hypothetical question: could we use big data in a sustainable manner to solve social problems such as homelessness, human trafficking, and education? The four barriers to creating and using big data to solve social problems include: 1) data are buried in administrative systems; 2) data governance standards are lacking; 3) data are often unreliable; and 4) data can cause unintended consequences (Desouza & Smith, 2014, p. 41). Before big data could be utilized to empower evidence-based decision-making for social problems, there needs to be improvements in data collection, organization, and analysis. The authors recommend four solutions to bridge the big data gap: 1) build global data banks on critical issues (such as human trafficking, global hunger, and poverty); 2) engage citizens and citizen science; 3) invest in data curators and analysis training; and 4) promote virtual collaboration (Desouza & Smith, 2014, p. 42-43).

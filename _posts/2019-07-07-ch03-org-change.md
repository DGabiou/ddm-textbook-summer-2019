## The Challenges of Big Data 

### Weapons of Math Destruction: Intro
The Big Data economy is based on math-powered applications that create huge pieces of data from an array of sources and impact
every form of industry. While many view big data as innovative and transformative, O’Neil (2016) cautions that the math
powered applications on which big data relies is traced back to the decisions of fallible humans. O’Neil (2016) gives a name
to these harmful types of models: Weapons of Math Destruction or WMDs for short. Throughout the introduction, O’Neil (2016)
cites instances of big data being misused and as a result causing serious damage. One example she shares is of Michelle Rhee’s
work as Chancellor of Washington, DC’s public school system. Rhee was hired to reform the failing school system and developed
a math-based application to evaluate the teachers to determine who should be fired and who should be rewarded for their
performance. The application was fraught with bad analysis and many teachers who were performing well ended up being fired.
O’Neil (2016) uses this example to reinforce her serious concern about WMDs but also to point out that there is a difference
between math analysis and actual “on-the-ground reality.”

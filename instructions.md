## Drafting Your Chapter

You are responsible for creating chapters that present key insights for each topic. The purpose of the exercise is to work collaboratively to create a robust set of notes that can serve as a future reference guide so you can remind yourself about details of the course or quickly identify chapters or articles you want to revisit. Different topics might require different approaches (some lend themselves to check-lists or best-practices, while others might focus on clearly articulating an idea or area of research.). 

In general, I would recomment approaching the assignment as an opportunity to make yourself into an expert on your topic, then sharing your knowledge in a _**clear**_ and _**concise**_ manner with classmates and the general public. Your name will be on each chapter, so submit something that you are willing to own. 

Your chapter should have four parts:

---


## (1) Topic Overview (approximately 1 page)

Summarize the themes and insights that are common across the readings. Organize them into a coherent topic overview.

Make sure to reference the evidence and data the authors use to support their arguments, when appropriate. 

When appropriate, go beyond a summary and offer your own analysis or a framework for best practices. 

---




## (2) Summaries (approximately 0.5 pages each)

Provide summaries of key arguments and insights provided in each chapter. This should be short, typically about half a page. 

Summary format will vary by content - sometime material is best organized with a few paragraphs of text, others with itemized lists, and in other cases you might want to include graphics or diagrams illustrate content.

## (3)  YellowDig Post

Each member will contribute a discussion question or an interesting insight to Yellowdig based on your chapter content. It can be specific to one of the chapters, a theme that ties them together, or a useful resource related to the content. **These are invitations to engage the content.**

You receive points for participating in YellowDig discussions:

* 1 point for a new pin with at least 50 words. 
* 2 points for a comment made to another pin. 
* 2 points if you receive a comment on your pin. 
* 1 point for liking another pin. 
* 5 points if you earn an instructor badge for an informative post. 
* max of 20 points can be earned each week. 
* max of 100 points can be earned overall. 

You are free to use whichever medium you like for the discussion questions. You can include links to articles, images, or videos on YellowDig. 

You can also embed images or videos in your summaries if you find them to be helpful to your topic. See the [Markdown Guide](http://ds4ps.org/ddm-textbook-summer-2019/markdown/) tab for instructions.

## (4) Citations and Bibliography

Cite material using the APA in-text citation style, e.g. Johnson (2012, p. 27). 

A bibliography for the assigned readings are already listed on the page shell. 

You are free to include additional material in the chapter if you want to explore beyond the assigned texts or reference other readings from the course. If you do, be sure to add the new sources to the bibliography.
